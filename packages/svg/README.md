- TODO: `react-native-macos` – React Native macOS
  - Could implement `<SvgUri>` with a port of https://github.com/alloc/react-native-svgkit
- TODO: `react-primitives` – React Primitives
  - This should probably be a stub with a `<View>`, and maybe render compute some rough SVG element sizes to render `<View>`s from
- TODO: `react-figma` – React Figma
  - `<SvgUri>` and `<SvgXml>` are possible
